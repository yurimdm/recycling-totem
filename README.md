# Intelligent Recycling Totem

### TOTEM FOR MATERIAL COLLECTION

_Reducing improper waste disposal_

A few years ago, along with some classmates, we managed to develop a sustainable project based on some technologies that are currently common in the market. My purpose here is not to expose the private work of others, but to bring to the public what referred to my part of this project, as I recover what was available from that time.

## Purpose

The idea of the project came from observing the daily life of the population of Santos, more specifically of ETEC Aristóteles Ferreira. From the observation made, it was noted that the entrance of the school, the bus stops, the beaches, and the streets of the city, in general, have a large number of cigarette butts and chewing gum.

In addition, even though there are specific collection points for batteries and, in some, bus stops for cigarette butts, people do not dispose of these materials correctly. Therefore, the need for motivation for correct disposal was noticeable.

Thus, the solution found was to recharge the cell phone battery, as cell phones are extremely necessary for people's daily lives and often there are no public places to charge them.
